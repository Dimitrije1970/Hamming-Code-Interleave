**Hamming-Code-Interleave** is a C++ program that implements Hamming (10, 6) code with interleaving and deinterleaving concepts in digital communications. Hamming codes are a type of error-correcting code that add redundant bits to a message to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission. Interleaving and deinterleaving are techniques used to improve the reliability of communication over noisy channels by reordering transmitted data.

The program provides functions for encoding and decoding messages using the Hamming (10, 6) code, as well as for interleaving and deinterleaving data. It also includes features for simulating a noisy communication channel by introducing errors into transmitted messages and measuring the error rate.
